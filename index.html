 								<p>Paying homage to the famous painting <i>Whistler’s Mother</i> while offering a personal perspective this unplanned portrait, portrays the man who instructed the artist in driving, cigar smoking, and the meticulous art of cleaning stainless steel.</p>
								<p>Through this contemporary reinterpretation, Allan explores the enduring importance of human connections and the transmission of knowledge and traditions between generations.

								<h3 class="year">2021</h3>
								<h3 class="medium">Digital ink-jet print on Epson Hot Press Bright<br />1016 mm x 738 mm</h3>
								
								<p>Lucy Cranwell, a name resonating through the lush underbelly of New Zealand’s botanical history. She shattered glass ceilings as the first female curator at the Auckland Museum and clinched Te Apārangi’s Hector Medal, making history once again. Partnered with Lucy Moore, their fieldwork blazed trails as the most extensive female endeavor in the nation’s annals. Cranwell’s mastery of pollen analysis unearthed an uncharted realm within New Zealand’s botanical past.</p>
								<p>Enter “My Mothers’ Garden,” a visual odyssey transcending time and space. Within this photographic series, we navigate the verdant labyrinth, deciphering the tales woven by flora. The garden, an ageless crucible, births narratives that transcend epochs. In the ephemeral ballet of petals and leaves, we confront the relentless march of history’s vulnerability. Each frozen moment, captured and preserved, becomes an eerie portrait, a cryptic document, a sentinel monument, echoing Cranwell’s pioneering spirit in the shadows of nature’s enigmatic whispers.</p>

								<h3 class="year">2011</h3>								
								<h3 class="medium">Photograph, acrylic, brass, silver</h3>
							
 								<p><i>Royal Gilded Ectoplasm</i>, a brooch crafted in 2010, represents a singular exploration of opulence, mystique, and the unattainable. Exclusively showcased in Amsterdam, it encapsulates the allure of regal decadence while challenging perceptions of material worth.</p>
								<p>Intriguingly, its counterpart the collar, <i>Shards of Royal Gilded Ectoplasm</i>, emerged solely for a shadow exhibition in Auckland, existing as an entirely separate entity. The two were never destined to meet physically, yet they share a conceptual thread that binds them—a dichotomy of unity and separation. The deconstructed portrait offers a fragmented glimpse into the essence of the brooch, inviting viewers to explore the enigma and allure beneath its surface.</p>
								<p>These parallel narratives, one of lavish grandeur and the other of dissected beauty, highlight the multiplicity of perspectives inherent in art. Together, they remind us of the acute impact of context on perception, and the endless possibilities for artistic expression and interpretation.</p>

 								<p><i>2XL</i>, an art project spanning from 2020 to 2023, is a compelling exploration of the transformative power of repurposed textiles, specifically fleece and yarn. This wearable diary serves as a testament to the journey of deconstruction and reinvention, unfolding over the course of three years.</p>
								<p>As textiles are deconstructed and reimagined, they embody the ever-changing nature of our lives, mirroring the cycles of growth, adaptation, and transformation that we all experience.</p>
								<p><i>2XL</i> aims to challenge conventional notions of fashion and consumerism by highlighting the beauty and sustainability of repurposed materials.

This sculpture, crafted from bronze and adorned with the opulence of 24-carat gold leaf, is a result of that visionary encounter. <i>Lycaena Boldenarum</i> captures the essence of human existence through the alchemy of materials and imagination. The addition of plant-dyed silk ribbon adds an organic and ephemeral element, reminding us of the intertwined relationship between humanity and the natural world.</p>

 								<p>In <i>Untitled (Gorse, Otago Peninsula)</i>, Thomas Lord explores the profound convergence of time within a single, large-format black and white photograph. This work examines the intricate layers of temporality, transcending the immediate snapshot and delving into the realms of geological, deep, and historical time.</p>
								<p>The geological time is evident in the Otago Peninsula landscape, shaped by years of natural processes. The deep time unveils the hidden stories of this land, revealing the whispers of its indigenous inhabitants and early European settlers. The enduring presence of gorse, an introduced and relentless invasive species, acts as a symbol of nature’s resilience through time. Long exposure photography reveals the subtle shifts and transitions occurring over extended moments, allowing viewers to witness the flow of time within the frame.</p>

	 							<blockquote>From “Carnival of the Animals” series.<br />Plain weave, hand woven on a countermarche loom in the studio of the Mandaweavians.
								</blockquote>
 																
								<p><i>Blah, Blah, Blah</i> channels the urgent and compelling words of Greta Thunberg’s 2021 United Nations speech into a visual fabric of climate consciousness. This textile pays homage to Thunberg’s impassioned plea for environmental action by rendering the complex data of global temperature change, spanning from 1870 to 2022, as an evocative array of stripes.</p>
								<p>The <i>#ShowYourStripes</i> woven panels, derived from the work of Ed Hawkins at the University of Reading, serve as both a testament to the undeniable truth of climate change and a rallying cry for collective action. Each stripe tells a story, representing a year’s deviation from the average temperature, calculated from the reference period of 1971–2000. Scientific data is transformed into a tangible narrative of our planet’s warming.</p>
								<p>The Mandaweavians are a guild of ancient thread smiths (established 2023) committed to the weave. Weavers of the watch adhere to weaving relevance by contributing to the guild’s mental welfare through creative acts and reverence for the world weave.</p>

 								<p>In the realm of ocular introspection, the artist seizes the dawning day as it emerges through the prism of the eye’s reflection. Here, a tableau of hope, renewal, or the poignant residue of significant moments unfolds. These diptychs offer a portal into the ever-shifting emotional terrain, the hidden threads weaving beneath the surface of our gaze. Through these abstract compositions, the artist beckons the spectator into the labyrinthine corridors of human expression and connection, all ensconced within the mesmerizing universe of the human iris and its refracted narratives. They serve as a poignant reminder that within the fathomless depths of our gaze, an infinite anthology of tales and sentiments lies in wait, eager to be unearthed and shared.</p>

 								<p><i>Underground</i> is an intimate artistic exploration that marries the tactile richness of collagraph and monotype techniques with the depth and emotion conveyed through oil paint on paper. This artwork invites viewers to dive beneath the surface, not only of the artwork but also into the overlooked landscapes that surround us.</p>
								<p>The subject, an obscure corner of a track beneath Steev Peyroux’s home, becomes a metaphor for the hidden and overlooked aspects of our lives, our environment, and our inner selves. The textured ground in the piece serves as both a literal and metaphorical foundation, embodying the layers of experience, memory, and emotion that underlie our existence.</p>
								<p>Through the interplay of texture and figurative imagery, <i>Underground</i> activates contemplation of the quiet, hidden corners of our world and the often-unnoticed beauty they hold. It reminds us to pause, appreciate the subtleties of our surroundings, and embrace the complexity that lies beneath the surface of our lives.</p>
