								<h3 class="year">2022</h3>								
								<h3 class="medium">Photograph</h3>

 								<p><i>Don’t You Press My Buttons</i> is a conceptual artwork that transforms the iconic typewriter, a symbol of bygone office culture, into a potent emblem of emotional tension within the contemporary workplace. This non-functional typewriter serves as a tangible touchpoint for the daily frustrations and anxieties experienced in the modern office environment.</p>
								<p>By rendering it inoperative, viewers are invited to confront their own feelings of powerlessness, stress, and the struggle to communicate ef- fectively in a world increasingly reliant on digital tools. The typewriter becomes a bed of nails for the intersection of technology and human emotion, highlighting the often discordant relationship between our desire for authentic connection and the pressures of productivity.</p>
								<p>Ponder the emotional landscape of the modern workplace, where the act of pressing buttons becomes a palpable expression of unspoken frustrations and the need for meaningful connection in an increasingly mechanised world.</p>
