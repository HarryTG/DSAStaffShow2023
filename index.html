								<p>Lucy Cranwell, a name resonating through the lush underbelly of New Zealand’s botanical history. She shattered glass ceilings as the first female curator at the Auckland Museum and clinched Te Apārangi’s Hector Medal, making history once again. Partnered with Lucy Moore, their fieldwork blazed trails as the most extensive female endeavor in the nation’s annals. Cranwell’s mastery of pollen analysis unearthed an uncharted realm within New Zealand’s botanical past.</p>
								<p>Enter “My Mothers’ Garden,” a visual odyssey transcending time and space. Within this photographic series, we navigate the verdant labyrinth, deciphering the tales woven by flora. The garden, an ageless crucible, births narratives that transcend epochs. In the ephemeral ballet of petals and leaves, we confront the relentless march of history’s vulnerability. Each frozen moment, captured and preserved, becomes an eerie portrait, a cryptic document, a sentinel monument, echoing Cranwell’s pioneering spirit in the shadows of nature’s enigmatic whispers.</p>

								<h3 class="year">2023</h3>
								<h3 class="medium">Expanding polyurethane and can (Gorilla)</h3>

 								<p><i>Industrial Barf</i> confronts the paradoxical nature of an everyday material often overlooked – expanding polyurethane foam. This abject object, found in many sculptors’ studios and commonly used for practical purposes like sealing gaps around windows, holds a complex history tainted with environmental toxicity.</p>
								<p>The sculpture embodies the transformation of this once highly toxic substance, now modified in its chemistry but still pervasive in our surroundings, silently leaching into the soil. Its persistence and resistance to decomposition mirror humanity’s negligence toward the environment. <i>It is difficult to destroy, you could set fire to it. The plumes of toxic smoke are black, I know I have tried.</i></p>
								<p><i>Industrial Barf</i> is a sombre reminder of the lasting impact of our industrial choices. It challenges us to confront our complicity in the degradation of our environment while highlighting the urgent need for responsible consumption and disposal practices. In this unassuming object, Beevors finds a potent symbol of our fraught relationship with the world we inhabit.</p>

 								<p><i>Don’t You Press My Buttons</i> is a conceptual artwork that transforms the iconic typewriter, a symbol of bygone office culture, into a potent emblem of emotional tension within the contemporary workplace. This non-functional typewriter serves as a tangible touchpoint for the daily frustrations and anxieties experienced in the modern office environment.</p>
								<p>By rendering it inoperative, viewers are invited to confront their own feelings of powerlessness, stress, and the struggle to communicate effectively in a world increasingly reliant on digital tools. The typewriter becomes a bed of nails for the intersection of technology and human emotion, highlighting the often discordant relationship between our desire for authentic connection and the pressures of productivity.</p>
								<p>Ponder the emotional landscape of the modern workplace, where the act of pressing buttons becomes a palpable expression of unspoken frustrations and the need for meaningful connection in an increasingly mechanised world.</p>

								<h3 class="medium">Photograph, acrylic, brass, silver</h3>
							
 								<p><i>Royal Gilded Ectoplasm</i>, a brooch crafted in 2010, represents a singular exploration of opulence, mystique, and the unattainable. Exclusively showcased in Amsterdam, it encapsulates the allure of regal decadence while challenging perceptions of material worth.</p>
								<p>Intriguingly, its counterpart the collar, <i>Shards of Royal Gilded Ectoplasm</i>, emerged solely for a shadow exhibition in Auckland, existing as an entirely separate entity. The two were never destined to meet physically, yet they share a conceptual thread that binds them—a dichotomy of unity and separation. The deconstructed portrait offers a fragmented glimpse into the essence of the brooch, inviting viewers to explore the enigma and allure beneath its surface.</p>
								<p>These parallel narratives, one of lavish grandeur and the other of dissected beauty, highlight the multiplicity of perspectives inherent in art. Together, they remind us of the acute impact of context on perception, and the endless possibilities for artistic expression and interpretation.</p>

								<h3 class="year">2023</h3>								
								<h3 class="medium">Oil on canvas</h3>

 								<p><i>Her Fertility Turned him into a Tree, after Jordaen</i>, pays homage to the Baroque era while shedding light on the timeless struggle for women’s rights. In an era where these rights are eroding worldwide, it becomes imperative to reflect on history and the persecution faced by women during the witch hunts. The Baroque masters’ works serve as a poignant backdrop to this narrative.</p>
								<p>Through the medium of oil on canvas, the work evokes a postmodern consciousness that challenges the traditional gender roles depicted by European artists of the past. The title itself alludes to the transformation of gender dynamics, as femininity’s power is symbolised by the transformative act of fertility, turning the oppressor into the oppressed.</p>
								<p><i>Her Fertility Turned him into a Tree</i> aims to foster a dialogue about the resilience of women throughout history, showcasing their enduring strength and the urgent need to protect and advance women’s rights in a world where they are once again under threat. This work serves as a reminder of the past and a call to action for a more equitable future.</p>

Through screenprint monoprints, Amy Dougherty explores the whales' dual nature, where their fluidity and elegance in their natural environment are juxtaposed with their potential threat and vulnerability. Through gestural rendering of their majestic forms, Dougherty aims to celebrate the awe-inspiring aesthetics of these creatures, highlighting their intrinsic beauty.</p> 
								<p>However, this portrayal is far from one-dimensional. It also serves as a poignant reminder of the existential threats faced by whales today. Their colossal presence and ecological importance are matched by the fragility of their existence in the face of human activities such as hunting, habitat destruction, and climate change.</p>

 								<p><i>Untitled (Head, Shield and Red Seat)</i> is a visual embodiment of a postcolonial discourse, probing the intricate interplay of cross-cultural relationships between Western and non-Western peoples. Through the medium of acrylic on canvas, Fletcher paints a visual narrative engaging with the complex discourse of history, identity, and power dynamics.
								<p>The painting’s elements, a head, a shield, and a red seat, symbolise the dichotomy of dominance and subjugation that often characterizes Western colonial encounters with non-Western cultures. The head signifies the imposition of Western ideologies, the shield represents resistance and resilience, while the red seat alludes to both a symbol of authority and a place of confrontation.</p>
								<p><i>Untitled (Head, Shield and Red Seat)</i> encourages viewers to reflect on the enduring legacy of colonialism and its impact on contemporary global dynamics. It serves as a visual catalyst for dialogue, empathy, and understanding, inviting us to confront the complexities of our shared history and move towards a more equitable and inclusive future.</p>

 								<p><i>Data Generator, Heavy Forms. Cache.</i> and <i>Data Generator, Folk Medicine. Cache.</i> are two interconnected artworks that investigate painting as both a deliberate process and an observational reflection.
								<p>Challenging the traditional boundaries of painting, the works move beyond mere representation into the space of propositional creation and observation. “Data Generator” references the act of generating, storing, and reinterpreting data, mirroring the intricate layers of our digital age.</p>
								<p>Through the transitive act of painting, viewers are invited to contemplate the intersection of intention and intuition, to traverse the shifting landscapes of art and information. These works offer a visual dialogue, where the act of creation becomes a bridge between the conceptual and the tangible, blurring the lines between proposal and observation, ultimately inviting us to reconsider the essence of artistic expression in the context of our data-driven world.</p>

 								<p><i>Forest Remnants, Pikikirunga Range</i> is a contemplative 4K screen work that invites viewers to immerse themselves in a world of natural beauty and consider the delicate balance between awe and unease. By allowing ourselves to reside in this exquisite tension, we open the door to new possibilities and ways of perceiving our role in the world.
								<p>Naïve wonder represents the unbridled curiosity of a child, the capacity to marvel at the world with untainted eyes. It embodies the purest form of human fascination, an unapologetic embrace of the mysteries that surround us. On the other hand, the discomfort of uncertainty symbolises the hesitance and trepidation that often accompanies the pursuit of knowledge.

								<h3 class="medium">MEDIUMDESCRIPTION</h3>

 								<p>Kiri Mitchell’s artistic exploration delves into the juxtaposition of middle-aged women and the hippopotamus, unravelling a complex tapestry of symbolism. The hippopotamus, seemingly gentle in its aquatic realm, becomes a compelling archetype that mirrors society’s treatment of middle-aged women. At first glance, the creature’s tranquil demeanour lures us into a false sense of security, echoing how middle-aged women have been relegated to the sidelines, their significance often underestimated.</p>
								<p>However, delving deeper, the menace within the hippopotamus unveils a parallel truth – the suppressed power and resilience that middle-aged women possess. Just as the creature fiercely defends its territory, middle-aged women too have fought against societal limitations, often erupting with a potent force to challenge expectations.</p>
								<p>The work questions societal perceptions, inviting viewers to reevaluate the multi-dimensional nature of middle-aged women. The juxtaposition of the hippopotamus archetype serves as a potent reminder that beneath the surface lies an intricate interplay of vulnerability and strength. It’s an invitation to recognize the fallacy of perceived safety and embrace the empowering, complex essence of womanhood.</p>
